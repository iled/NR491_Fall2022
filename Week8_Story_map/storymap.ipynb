    "**HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language used for files meant to be displayed in a web browser. HTML syntax is similar to the `markdown` syntax used in these `jupyter notebooks`. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML):\n",
    "\n",
    "\"HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as `<img />` and `<input />` directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as `<p>` surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.\"\n",

The second block instructs the browser to load the Leaflet code library, the open-source software that constructs the interactive map. The third block describes where the map and title should be positioned on the screen. The good news is that you don’t need to touch any of those blocks of code, so leave them as-is.
